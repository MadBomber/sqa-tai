## Practical Example

Complete trading example with context:

```ruby
require 'sqa/tai'

# Real-world scenario
historical_prices = [
  # ... price data ...
]

# Calculate indicator
result = SQA::TAI.indicator_name(historical_prices, period: 14)

# Analysis logic
current_value = result.last
previous_value = result[-2]

if current_value > threshold && previous_value <= threshold
  puts "BUY Signal: Indicator crossed above threshold"
  puts "Entry: #{historical_prices.last}"
  puts "Stop Loss: #{calculate_stop_loss}"
elsif current_value < threshold && previous_value >= threshold
  puts "SELL Signal: Indicator crossed below threshold"
end
```
